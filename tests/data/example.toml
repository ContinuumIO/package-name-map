# packages from one ecosystem may map to many packages in another.  One entry should be present for each possible match
#  For example, here graphviz in conda is both a dev package (headers + link libraries) and a runtime, while Debian splits
#  out the dev package and the runtime.  Additionally, Debian is carrying an old name for the devel package, so we should
#  track that, too.

# Instead of duplicate entries for transitional or renamed packages, we collect lists
#   These could be extended into individual columns, or perhaps be one table per key that is then joined somehow
